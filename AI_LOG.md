# AI Log

How we used AI to build Adapty Flywheel at First Commit: Adapty Hackathon Belgrade (November 7–8, 2026). The step-by-step version, with the reasoning behind each decision, is in [docs/AI_JOURNEY.md](docs/AI_JOURNEY.md).

## Tools and what we used them for

| Tool | Used for |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (VS Code extension, Claude Opus 5.5) | Our main pair programmer: research, data analysis, coding, writing |
| **Adapty Developer CLI** | Reading and changing the Lumen demo account (analytics, flows, placements), called by Claude and by the Adapty skills |
| **OpenAI image API** | Text-free banner visuals in the product. All text is rendered by us, in code. |

## Our setup

- **Rules and memory:** Claude Code's persistent project memory holds the event rules, our plan, data findings and environment quirks (for example, "run Python through PowerShell, not Bash"). [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) is the shared spec both of us and Claude work from.
- **Skills, scoped to this repo only** (`.claude/skills/`, 23 in total): Adapty's official pack (flow-generator, ab-tests, growth-advisor and others), 8 marketing skills, and Anthropic's frontend-design. We read every skill's files for hooks, scripts and network calls before installing it. We dropped overlapping skills so that two of them never compete for the same request.
- **MCP:** not connected on purpose. The Adapty MCP server can write to the account; the CLI gives us the same reads with commands we can see and review.
- **Subagents:** <!-- TODO: fill in once we use them (e.g. parallel research or a review agent before the demo) --> none yet.

## Prompts that worked well

1. *"check if there are instructions on how the repo should look for adaptys hackathon. also here: <Notion link>"* — Claude went past the empty page fetch, read Notion's page data directly, followed links to a second, more detailed guide, and came back with a gap list for our repo.
2. *(paraphrased)* "Find the Claude Code setup a past hackathon winner open-sourced, but check whether it's worth installing." — it surfaced a 300+ skill bundle and also the README's own warning about context cost, which is why we built a small, curated set instead.
3. TODO: one prompt from building the product itself.

## One thing AI got wrong, and how we caught it

Claude's saved memory said the judging criteria "were not published" and treated the AI log as an open-ended journal. Working from that, we had written a 3-page log. When we asked Claude to check the organizers' pages directly, it found the Participant Guide: fixed judging weights, and an AI log of ½–1 page with set contents. **Lesson:** memory is a cache, not a source. We now recheck rules against the official page before building on them.

## What we'd never delegate to AI

- **Numbers shown on stage.** Every figure in the demo is recomputed by a script from the raw data, not quoted from a chat.
- **Anything that touches real users or real money:** publishing a flow, starting an A/B test, ad spend. The AI drafts; we confirm.
- **Secrets.** API keys stay in `.env` and are never pasted into chat.
- **The call on what's real vs. mocked**, and the honesty of how we present it.
